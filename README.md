# Login-Script-For-Github

I use GitHub for reviewing my code,  and I have collaborated with other programmers so in unimportant reasons I usually log out  from my GitHub Account  after finishing My project, so I decided to create easy automation with selenium using python to help me stay productive and  logging into my account instead of me doing it manually 



So you wll require to install python3 , Selenium and Chromedriver
